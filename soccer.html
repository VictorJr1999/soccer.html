          <p>Driven by a young, diverse and digitally savvy demographic, soccer has grown by leaps and bounds since the 1994 FIFA World Cup was held on U.S. soil and Major League Soccer (MLS) was born two years later. The world’s most popular sport is expected to continue its upward trajectory with this summer’s FIFA Women’s World Cup in Australia/New Zealand as well as the 2024 Copa America and 2026 FIFA World Cup coming to North America.

          <p>Soccer fans are younger and more diverse than general sports fans in the United States, according to Morning Consult. More than half (54%) of the respondents who identified as soccer fans were under the age of 45, compared to NBA (51%), NFL (46%) and MLB (43%). MLS says it boasts the youngest fan base of any men’s pro league in the country.</p>
          <p>Not only are U.S. soccer fans younger, but they’re also more culturally diverse, with 40% being fans of color, per Morning Consult. MLS reports approximately 30% of its fans are Hispanic or Latino.</p>
